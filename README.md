# VkRender2

This is/will be a renderer, better than my previous iterations.

Some goals:

- implementing enough techniques to reach a point where
  I'm comfortable enough with the Vulkan to build a render graph so I never
  have to manually lay a sync barrier ever again
- not building wacky abstractions
- making some cool renders
